# Firstly we will use the download.file function to download the file and then use destfile function to give a location to the downloaded file

# Question 1. Read in the file, making the gene accession numbers the row names. Show a table of values for the first six genes.
gene <- read.table("gene_expression.tsv")

str(gene)

# Question 2. Make a new column which is the mean of the other columns. Show a table of values for the first six genes.
